        <p>A webpage where you will be able to study programming terms using the flashcards below.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="oneH">Javascript</h3>
          <p id="oneP">An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="twoH">Operators</h3>
          <p id = "twoP">In mathematics and sometimes in computer programming, an operator is a character that represents an action.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="threeH">Variables</h3>
          <p id="threeP">In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="fourH">Variable Naming Convention</h3>
          <p id ="fourP">In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="fiveH">Functions</h3>
          <p id="fiveP">A named section of a program that performs a specific task.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="sixH">Methods</h3>
          <p id="sixP">A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="sevenH">Arguments</h3>
          <p id="sevenP">Are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="eightH">Parameters</h3>
          <p id="eightP">A parameter is a special kind of variable in computer programming language that is used to pass information between functions or procedures. The actual information passed is called an argument.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="nineH">Return</h3>
          <p id="nineP">A return statement is the information that part of a computer program gives to another part. In object-oriented programming, the term return is used by methods to perform an output. ... Specifically what is returned depends on an special identifier called a return type.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="tenH">Chaining Methods</h3>
          <p id="tenP">also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="elevenH">Strings</h3>
          <p id="elevenP">any finite sequence of characters (i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks). An important characteristic of each string is its length, which is the number of characters in it. The length can be any natural number (i.e., zero or any positive integer).</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "col-md-2">
          <h3 id="twelveH">Booleans</h3>
          <p id="twelveP">a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false), intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="fourteenH">NaN</h3>
          <p id="fourteenP">an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations.</p>

        <div class="col-md-2">
          <h3 id="fiveteenH">Escape</h3>
          <p id="fiveteenP">two or more characters that often begin with an escape character that tells the computer or software program to perform a function or command.</p>
